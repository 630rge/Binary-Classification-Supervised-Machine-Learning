# Supervised Machine Learning | Binary Classification
This repository contains code for performing binary classification using multiple algorithms to compare results. Binary classification is a type of supervised machine learning task where the goal is to classify elements into one of two classes.
## Algorithms Used
The following algorithms are implemented and compared in this repository:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Trees
3. Random Forest
4. Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGD)
5. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the algorithms is [Clickbait Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amananandrai/clickbait-dataset). This dataset contains 32000 samples and 1 feature. Each sample is labeled with either class 0 or class 1.
## Results
After creating the model, the results of each algorithm's performance will be displayed, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, visualizations such as confusion matrices and Area Under Curve - Receiver operating characteristic (AUCROC) may also be provided for better understanding of the results.
## Conclusion
Based on the results obtained from the comparison, conclusions can be drawn regarding the performance of each algorithm on the given dataset. It's important to consider factors such as accuracy, computational complexity, and interpretability when selecting the most suitable algorithm for a particular task
